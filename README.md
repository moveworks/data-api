# Moveworks Data Pipeline

A robust Python-based data pipeline that extracts data from the Moveworks Analytics API and loads it into Snowflake with comprehensive analytics views.

## 🎯 Overview

This pipeline provides:
- **Initial Historical Load**: Bulk load historical data with user-defined date ranges
- **Daily Incremental Sync**: Automated daily updates using UPSERT operations
- **Analytics Views**: Pre-built views for BI tools and reporting
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and error recovery
- **Monitoring**: Detailed logging and progress tracking

## 📋 Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Network access to Moveworks API and Snowflake

### Python Dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running a python virtual env 
Installing the required dependencies in your system can throw error or challenges. We strongly recommend you to run a virtual environment of python and then install the dependencies
to enable a virtual env run the following command. 
``` bash
python3 -m venv moveworks_env
source moveworks_env/bin/activate
```
install the dependencies again after this command. 


### Required Credentials
1. **Moveworks API Access Token**
   - Contact your Moveworks admin for API credentials

2. **Snowflake Account Details**
   - Account identifier (e.g., `xyz12345.us-east-1`)
   - Username and password
   - Warehouse, database, and schema names
   - Optional: Role (if required)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
python3 main-script.py setup
```
This interactive setup will prompt for:
- Moveworks API token
- Snowflake connection details
- Pipeline configuration (schedule, analytics views, etc.)

### 2. Historical Data Load
```bash
python3 main-script.py initial-load
```
- Choose your historical date range (recommended: 30-90 days to start)
- Loads data for: conversations, interactions, plugin-calls, plugin-resources, users
- Creates analytics views if configured

### 3. Start Daily Automation
```bash
python3 main-script.py start
```
- Runs daily at configured time (default: 22:00 PST)
- Uses UPSERT operations to prevent duplicates
- Updates analytics views automatically

## 🔍 Data Validation

### Quick Data Quality Checks
```sql
-- Check row counts across all tables
SELECT 'CONVERSATIONS' as table_name, COUNT(*) as row_count FROM MOVEWORKS_CONVERSATIONS
UNION ALL
SELECT 'INTERACTIONS', COUNT(*) FROM MOVEWORKS_INTERACTIONS
UNION ALL
SELECT 'PLUGIN_CALLS', COUNT(*) FROM MOVEWORKS_PLUGIN_CALLS
UNION ALL
SELECT 'PLUGIN_RESOURCES', COUNT(*) FROM MOVEWORKS_PLUGIN_RESOURCES
UNION ALL
SELECT 'USERS', COUNT(*) FROM MOVEWORKS_USERS;

-- Check data freshness
SELECT 
    MAX(CREATED_AT) as latest_conversation,
    MAX(LOAD_TIMESTAMP) as latest_load
FROM MOVEWORKS_CONVERSATIONS;

-- Verify UPSERT operations (check for duplicates)
SELECT ID, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count 
FROM MOVEWORKS_CONVERSATIONS 
GROUP BY ID 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### Analytics View Testing
```sql
-- Test each analytics view
SELECT * FROM V_DAILY_SUMMARY ORDER BY activity_date DESC LIMIT 7;
SELECT * FROM V_TOTAL_CONVERSATIONS WHERE conversation_date >= CURRENT_DATE - 7;
SELECT * FROM V_ACTIVE_USERS WHERE activity_date >= CURRENT_DATE - 7;
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. API Authentication Errors
```
Error: 401 Unauthorized
```
**Solution**: Verify API token in configuration
```bash
python3 moveworks_pipeline.py setup  # Re-enter credentials
```

#### 2. Snowflake Connection Issues
```
Error: Failed to connect to Snowflake
```
**Solutions**:
- Check network connectivity
- Verify account identifier format
- Confirm user permissions
- Test connection manually:
```sql
-- Test in Snowflake console
SELECT CURRENT_USER(), CURRENT_ROLE(), CURRENT_WAREHOUSE();
```

#### 3. Rate Limiting
```
Warning: Rate limited on /endpoint. Waiting for X seconds.
```
**Solution**: This is normal - the script will automatically retry. Consider:
- Running during off-peak hours
- Reducing date range for initial loads

#### 4. Data Type Errors
```
Error: Expression type does not match column data type
```
**Solution**: Usually resolved in the fixed script version. If persistent:
- Check for API schema changes
- Verify pandas version compatibility

#### 5. Table Creation Failures
```
Error: Failed to create table MOVEWORKS_X
```
**Solutions**:
- Verify Snowflake permissions (CREATE TABLE)
- Check database and schema exist
- Ensure role has necessary privileges

### Emergency Recovery

#### Reset Everything
```bash
# Reset pipeline state
python3 main-script.py reset

# Manual Snowflake cleanup (if needed)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MOVEWORKS_CONVERSATIONS;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MOVEWORKS_INTERACTIONS;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MOVEWORKS_PLUGIN_CALLS;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MOVEWORKS_PLUGIN_RESOURCES;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS MOVEWORKS_USERS;

# Drop views
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS V_TOTAL_CONVERSATIONS;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS V_TOTAL_INTERACTIONS;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS V_ACTIVE_USERS;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS V_KNOWLEDGE_PERFORMANCE;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS V_DAILY_SUMMARY;
```
